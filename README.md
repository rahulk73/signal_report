# Signal Report 

## This is a simple application that works by -

- Determining the associated UID(s) of the signal(s) selected by the user for which they need a report of.
- Sending a query to the mySQL databse for the chosen signal(s) within the selected time interval using the UID(s).
- Analyzing this data to determine information such as the last recorded value,average and consumption according to the selected time interval (in the case of measurement or meter signals only).
- Appending this data to either a new or template (predefined) excel spreadsheet in a neat manner.
- There is also native chart support of the recorded data corresponding to each signal chosen (again, in the case of measurement or meter signals only).

## Getting Started : First Steps

After downloading the MSI from the link on top and opening it, an installation wizard will walk you through the steps to complete installation. Once you have the application installed, you can start using it via the desktop shortcut created.*
Navigating the application and using its features is fairly straightforward so there should not be a problem getting familiar with it. I have created a simple pdf which documents its features and working and can be viewed from the link below in case of any trouble.
